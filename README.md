## 📌 Project Overview

This application allows:

- **Buyers** to browse, search, filter, and like products
- **Sellers** to add, update, manage, and hide their own products
- **Admins** to manage users and control platform access

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate **clean Flask architecture**, **ORM usage**, **migrations**, and **real-world business logic** rather than UI design.
